Paper 21 Problem-solving and Programming May/June 2022 - PRE-RELEASE MATERIAL

In preparation for the examination candidates should attempt the following practical tasks by writing and testing a program or programs.

Friends of Seaview Pier is an organisation devoted to the restoration and upkeep of a pier in the town. A pier is a wooden structure that provides 
a walkway over the sea. ThePier requires regular maintenance and the friends of the pier need to raise money for this purpose.

Members of Friends of Seaview Pier each pay 75$ per year, as a contribution to the pier's running costs. This entitles them to free admission to the pier
throughout the year. They can also volunteer to help run the pier, by working at the pier enterance gate, working in the gift shop, or painting and 
decorating.

To provide additional income, the pier's wooden planks can be sponsored. A brass plaque, which contains a short message of the sponsor's choice, is fitted
to a plank on the pier, for a donation of $200.

Write and test a program or programs for the Friends of Seaview Pier:

- Your program or programs must include appropiate prompts for the entry of data. Data must be validated on entry.
- All outputs, including error messages, need to be set out clearly and understandably.
- All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meangingful names.

You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

TASK 1 - Becoming a member of Friends of Seaview Pier

Set up a system to enable people to become members of Friends of Seaview Pier and for each new member enter: 

- Their first name and last name
- whether or not they wish to work as a volunteer
- If they choose to be a volunteer, identify the area from:
  - The pier enterance gate
  - The gift shop
  - Painting and decorating
- The date of joining
- whether or not they have paid the $75 fee.

All of this inforamtion needs tob be stored using suitable data structures.

TASK 2 - Using membership data

Extend the program in TASK 1 so that a list of the first and last names of members can be output in any of the following categories:

- Members who have chosen to work as volunteers.
- Volunteers who would like to work at the pier enterance gate.
- Volunteers who would like to work at the gift shop.
- Volunteers who would like to help with the painting and decorating tasks.
- Members whose membership has expired (they have not re-joined this year)
- Members who have not yet paid their $75 fee.

TASK 3 - Sponsoringa wooden plank

Add an additional option to the program in TASK 1 to enable the pier's wooden planks to be sponsored. Separate data structures should be used to store the
names of the individuals and the short messages they would like to have written on their brass plaque. An ouput would display everything that was input for
the sponsor to confirm. If errors are found, the program should allow data to be re-entered. Once complete, the data is stored and the sponsor is charged
$200.
